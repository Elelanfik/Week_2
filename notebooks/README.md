# Notebooks Directory

## Overview
This directory contains Jupyter notebooks designed for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of user engagement metrics within the telecom industry. Each notebook focuses on different aspects of the data, providing insights that can help improve user experience and engagement.

## Purpose
The notebooks serve as a platform for:
- Analyzing user engagement metrics such as session frequency, duration, and total traffic.
- Visualizing key findings to identify trends and patterns in user behavior.
- Supporting data-driven decision-making for enhancing Quality of Service (QoS).

## Getting Started
To use the notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter**: Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't done so:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter

1. Open Notebooks: Navigate to this directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

2. Select a Notebook: Click on the desired notebook file to open it in your browser.
